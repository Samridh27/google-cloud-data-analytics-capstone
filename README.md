# 📊 Google Cloud Data Analytics Capstone Project

This project was completed as part of the Google Cloud Data Analytics Professional Certificate program.
The capstone demonstrates end-to-end cloud-based data analytics using:
- Google BigQuery (data processing & warehousing)
- Google Cloud Storage
- Looker Enterprise (data visualization & dashboarding)
- SQL (Advanced queries, CTAS, joins, nested data handling)

# 🚀 Project Overview

In this capstone, I worked within a fintech business scenario to:
- Collect and import structured datasets into BigQuery
- Transform and clean data using SQL
- Build derived tables using CTAS (Create Table As Select)
- Handle nested and semi-structured data
- Develop interactive dashboards in Looker Enterprise
- Configure automated dashboard refresh schedules
The project simulates real-world cloud data analyst responsibilities.

# 🏗️ Part 1: Data Collection & Processing (BigQuery)

## Key Tasks Performed:

- Explored fintech datasets (customers & loans tables)
- Imported CSV data from Cloud Storage into BigQuery
- Performed table joins across multiple datasets
- Created new tables using CTAS
- Queried nested fields using dot notation
- Removed duplicates using SELECT DISTINCT
- Built aggregated reporting tables using GROUP BY and COUNT

## Example Query (CTAS):

# 📈 Part 2: Data Visualization & Activation (Looker Enterprise)

Built an interactive dashboard titled:
**Loan Insights Dashboard**

## Visualizations Created:
- Total Outstanding Loan Balance (Single Value KPI)
- Percentage of Outstanding Loans by Status (Pie Chart)
- Top 10 States by Outstanding Loan Count (Bar Chart)
- Top 10 Customers by Highest Income (Sortable Table)

## Advanced Features:
- Conditional formatting (threshold-based KPI alerts)
- Filtered business logic (Current loans, Owned homes)
- Top-N ranking
- Scheduled automatic refresh:
    - KPI: Hourly
    - Customer & Status insights: Daily
- Dashboard optimization for usability and accessibility

# 📊 Business Impact Simulation
This dashboard enables stakeholders to:
- Monitor loan exposure in real time
- Identify high-risk loan distributions
- Analyze regional loan concentration
- Track high-income customers with active loans
- Make data-driven financial decisions

# 🎯 Key Cloud Data Skills Applied
- Cloud-based data warehousing
- ETL & transformation
- Structured & semi-structured data handling
- Data modeling
- KPI reporting
- Interactive dashboard development
- Business-focused analytics
